# Chapter 1. Introduction

- there's a lot of genomic data (whole genome, single-cell transcriptomics, etc) and there's a lot more coming
- "The promise is that the copious amounts of data and variety of new data types will allow researchers to get closer to answering some of the most difficult — if vexingly simple to ask — questions in biology. For example, how many cell types exist in the human body? What genetic variants cause disease? How do cancers arise, and can we predict them earlier?"
- the public cloud: computational services made available on demand over the internet
- the traditional approach where everyone has to download and store their own copy of the data won't work with the huge datasets and large number of datasets being generated now
- not everyone has a compute cluster with thousands of CPUs/GPUs always available
- standards enable the use of data regardless of platform and cloud e.g. file format standards like BAM, CRAM, VCF, etc and application programming interface (API) standards
- 'The Data Biosphere emphasizes four key pillars: it should be community driven, standards based, modular, and open source.'
- FAIR principles: research/systems/tools/data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable
- 'by embracing the cloud, writing portable workflows in languages like WDL, running analysis in Terra, and sharing workflows on Dockstore, researchers can make their own work more FAIR.'
