# Chapter 2: Genomics in a Nutshell: A Primer for Newcomers to the Field

- Genes are relatively short segments of DNA
- DNA is made up of four nucleotides: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T)
- A base pairs with T through two hydrogen bonds
- G base pairs with C through three hydrogen bonds
- long strings of DNA make up chromosomes
- human beings are diploid i.e. two copies of each chromosome, one inherited from each parent
- as a result, we have two copies of every gene that is present on both chromosomes (most genes)
- for a given gene, the two copies (not strictly identical) are called alleles
- you pass on to your offspring one chromosome from each of your 23 pairs, and accordingly one of your two alleles for every gene
- the allele concept is also used for individual variants instead of the overall gene
- microorganisms such as bacteria are generally haploid, meaning they have only one copy of their chromosome, but they can have an array of optional mini-chromosomes called plasmids.
- Fungi can be haploid or diploid at different stages of their life cycles.
- the gene is made up of introns and exons
- the introns are spliced out leaving the exons which code for proteins
- 'Although the X-shaped form is their most common representation in popular media, our chromosomes don’t spend much time looking like that. Most of the time they are in a rod-shaped form called a chromatid.'
- 'When the single chromatid is copied ahead of a cell division event, the two identical chromatids are connected by a central region called the centromere, resulting in the popular X shape.'
- 'Just before the cell division that produces eggs and sperm cells, the parental chromosome copies pair up and swap segments with each other in a process called chromosomal recombination, which shuffles the combinations of physically linked traits that will be transmitted to the progeny.'
- 'The central dogma of biology: DNA leads to RNA; RNA leads to amino acids; amino acids lead to protein.'
