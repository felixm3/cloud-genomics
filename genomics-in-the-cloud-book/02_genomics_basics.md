# Chapter 2: Genomics in a Nutshell: A Primer for Newcomers to the Field

- Genes are relatively short segments of DNA
- DNA is made up of four nucleotides: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T)
- A base pairs with T through two hydrogen bonds
- G base pairs with C through three hydrogen bonds
- long strings of DNA make up chromosomes
- human beings are diploid i.e. two copies of each chromosome, one inherited from each parent
- as a result, we have two copies of every gene that is present on both chromosomes (most genes)
- for a given gene, the two copies (not strictly identical) are called alleles
- you pass on to your offspring one chromosome from each of your 23 pairs, and accordingly one of your two alleles for every gene
- the allele concept is also used for individual variants instead of the overall gene
